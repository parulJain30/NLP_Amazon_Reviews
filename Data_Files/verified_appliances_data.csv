1,B00006JKZX,"unit came on time box looked in great condition i was wrong .i had read reviews about packageing and since everyone like the unit i decided to order it anyway bad move was dented, metal twisted,. knob broken off.none of it was amazons fault .its all on sanyo poorest packageing i have ever seen may be great unit but not worth it",Defect
4,B00006JKZX,"I purchased the Sanyo kegerator as a surprise gift for my husband's 40th birthday. He's wanted one of these FOREVER. He's brewed his own beer in the past and has wanted to do it again for awhile and this purchase will enable him to do that without all the bottling etc. As other reviewers have mentioned, having received and been using this product for nearly a month now, it is a great deal in this price category. It functions very well, stays cold, assembly was very straightforward. We are enjoying it.

Having said all that, I must caution the purchaser that Amazon has not figured out how to ship this without damaging it. The first attempt to ship this to us, on time BEFORE my husband's birthday, failed miserably. Apparently it was damaged so badly during shipping that UPS deemed it undeliverable. Guess what? Birthday surprise ruined because now the item wouldn't make it in time for his birthday. After contacting Amazon a replacement was ordered and shipped immediately. We were out of town to receive that shipment but it arrived on time and was put in our garage. When we got home and my husband opened it we were very disappointed to find nearly every side of the kegerator was damaged in some way... scratched, dented etc. However, it was obvious that the machine would still work, so we decided to see if Amazon would reduce the price and if so, we'd keep it damaged. I have to say that through all of this process, the Amazon customer service representatives that I dealt with were incredibly helpful and always looking for how to make this right for us.

All in all, I'd recommend this product.",Defect
3,B00006JKZX,"I purchased this product based on many hours of research and favorable product reviews.  The best feature about this is that this Keg Cooler will hold all stiles of kegs, even the Coors kegs, witch seem to be a problem with many of the cheaper keg coolers.  The Keg cooler also keeps the beer very cold, I recently had a party and the keg cooler was outside in 90 degree heat and still kept the beer at 34 degrees..

My only issue is with the shipping.  This is also something I had read on many reviews,and the only reason this only got 3 out of 5 stars..  It took three attempts before I got a keg cooler that was not damaged.  The first two showed up so damaged that I refused shipment delivery.  The first one was so damaged even the delivery driver was surprised.  I think there are two problems with the shipping.  First the keg cooler is not packed well. This has to be the fault of the manufacturer.  The second is UPS,  this is 90+ pounds and I think the guys loading it just don't care and instead of picking it up they flip it end for end or roll it around.

Don't get me wrong I love the keg cooler but I think I would not get one online after this experience.  I would try and find someone local and get it from them.  This way you can inspect it before you purchase it..",No defect
4,B00006JKZX,"This prduct came fairly well shipped. There was a small ding on the back metal housing but that was easy to fix.  The temp controller seems a bit finnicky but it can definitely get the beer cold enough.  I even froze a glass of water that I had in there to check the temp.  The drip tray is just plain stupid but all the hardware (regulator, tap, tower) seem solid and well made.  There are certain things that let you know this kegerator is not top of the line but for the price it performs well and is worth having draft beer at home.",No defect
4,B00006JKZX,tubing for beer tap is only 3 ft - needs 5 -8 ft for better beer taste,No defect
1,B00006JKZX,Do not order this kegerator from amazon. It arrived damaged due to lack of proper packaging. Both sides of the kegerator were smashed in and the top was crooked. The packaging consisted of a 1/2 inch thick piece of styrofoam on top and nothing protecting the sides except for the cardboad box. If you are going to purchase this product (there are good reviews) get it from a store where you can check it out before purchasing.,Defect
3,B00006JKZX,"it is a good beer dispenser, very cold beer, nice looking unit.  most of the parts are good quality. had the haier(spelling issue) unit before, always had problems.  this  sanyo, so far, has exceeded the expectations.  the larger cooling panel is very helpful and needed.  the only complaint I have is the shipping.  unit arrived very beat up and battered.  not sanyo nor amazon's fault, just a common problem with anything shipped UPS. will attempt to get a resolution to that in the comming days. I will keep you posted. other very minor complaints, screw holes are not lined up well at all.  you will be best advised to tap your own holes before screwing anything down.  instructions are rather poor. if you don't already know about kegorators you will not know how to run this, research co2 adjustments and pressures first.  the castors on the bottom should be locking.  easy enough replacement if you have any handyman ability.  but manufacturer should have thought about that first.  and as you've read in other reviews, the drip pan is extremely half arsed and cheap.",Defect
5,B00006JKZX,"I've had this product a month now and its working out great.  The instructions are very detailed and allow someone with no kegerator experience to be up and running quickly.

The beer definitely tastes better and you can get any beer you want from BevMo.  I've been very pleased at how long a keg lasts!  I thought they would go bad quickly but I haven't had one go bad yet.",No defect
3,B00006JKZX,"This beer kegorator does work well but not right out of the box. so if you do not have time to tweek it I am not sure which way to go. there were dents all over the outside, the beer line was not long enough to clear the foam. because of the non cooled tower you must be ready to pour the first ounce into a spare glass then pour the real beer.",Defect
1,B00006JKZX,"I ordered this for my husband's Christmas gift. It arrived on Christmas Eve absolutely destroyed! We think it fell of a forklift. I sent it back for a replacement, only to get that one severely damaged on the top. The packaging is not nearly enough to protect such a large shipment. Finally got a refund and bought one locally after negotiating an internet price.",Defect
5,B00009V3UV,"After months of searching for gas drip pans and being told by various merchants that I had an ""old"" gas stove for which drip pans were no longer manufactured, I was thrilled to find these.  Unpon receipt, I was estatic!  These pans are beautiful and serve the purpose well.  Easy to clean and seems durable.  I ordered multiple sets.",No defect

5,B00009V3UV,Purchased these for our camper stove. They fit well and really look nice. Can't even tell they are on the stove. Pans were packaged very well and delivered ahead of stated date.,No defect
4,B00009V3UV,The drip pan is durable and color coordinated with my stove.  The only disappointment was that it is approximatelu 1/2 inch smaller than I expected it to be; othwise I am satisfied with the quality of the product. The next time I will order a larger size.,No defect
4,B00009V3UV,Just what I ordered.  Old stove looks like new now. Just wish the bowl part of the bib was just a little wider.,No defect
5,B00009V3UV,My mom purchased a new stove that didn't have drip pans.  These were perfect and still holding up almost a year later.  Awesome product.,No defect
2,B00009V3UV,This one could not use water and detergent to clean.  The one with Chrome plating was easier to clean.,Defect
5,B00009V3UV,"I searched high and low on line and in specialty stores for this product.  One day I am searching for something else on Amazon and this item appeared (not sure how) anyway I bought 4 of them, they fit perfect and look great!  My stove top looks new again.",No defect
5,B00009V3UV,"Good as supposed to be. I've been looking for these simple but very useful things in shoping malls and couldn't find! Finally I've got them here and am very-very happy. From now, will always shop for them in Amazon.",No defect
3,B00009V3UF,The products were new and exactly what was needed. Unfortunately they didn't fit my gas range.  They were returned with no problem except I had to pay all the shipping (to me and back to them) which was almost what I paid for the product. I would buy from them again but I would make sure they fit what I needed.,Defect
2,B00009V3UF,"didn't quite fit our oven.  I used a drill to widen the holes and now it works well.

1,B00009V3UF,Have a cheap crapy stove and didn't fit,Defect
1,B00009V3UF,"Really couldn't give it any stars as it didn't fit my stove.  Even with the attachments that were provided, it still wouldn't fit. Had to return it. But I will say that the product looked nice, wish it would have fit, then I would have saved the $19 it cost to purchase from the company who made the stovetop. That was for one knob.",Defect
1,B00009V3UF,I'm disappointed. does not fit the model Frigidaire,Defect
4,B00009V3UF,"Not as wide as the original so two of them hit mounting screws for the top. They work good, you just need to get use to a new way of pushing down the two that have the conflict",No defect
3,B00009V3UF,"Universal knob fit the stove, but because the dials on my stove are a bit old and does not turn easily, the universal attachment had the knob sitting a bit high and does not provide adequate torque to turn knob.",No defect
1,B00009V3UF,did not work on my Kenmore gas range.  the knobs were not long enough to work properly on my gas range.  still looking for replacements.,Defect
1,B00009V3UF,"Tried on Maytag. No luck. Purchased O.E.M Expensive,& they work!.",Defect
3,B00009V3UF,"They'll do, I guess.  Something that I would use for a rental instead of a high-end kitchen.",No defect
4,B00009V3UF,Worked like a charm on a very old stove.,No defect
3,B00009V3UF,Expensive and melted after a while. Not sure why white knobs are more expensive.,Defect
1,B00009V3UF,Didn't fit - the extensions weren't long enough for my stove.,Defect
1,B00009V3UF,"This product does not fit my gas stove at all. It goes over the knobs but is too big so I am not able to push the buttons in to turn on the stove. Also, there is nothing preventing them from falling off like a stopper or something that clasps them onto the stove. I am unable to use this product at all and will be returning it .",Defect
1,B00009V3UF,"Our stove comes with the push in auto ignite feature, the fittings did not work for it. these were a waste of time for our whirlpool stove.",Defect
4,B00009V3UF,I wasn't sure if these would work for our GE gas range.  The fit perfectly and were easy to replace.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again.,No defect
5,B00009V3UF,"Fit my stove, work great , look pretty. I would recommend them if I knew someone else who needed them .",No defect
3,B00009V3UF,"These knobs seem well made and the universal fit set up seems thought out. That said it did not fit my GE stove. Oh Well.... To be fair there are thousands of stoves out there and no ""universal fit"" set up will be really universal. I'll go to a local appliance parts place that I have an account at with a sample and the model number. 4 O.E.M. knobs probably $10 each, 4x the price of this kit.
KDM",No defect
3,B00009V3UF,"I have a GE gas stove and these didn't fit.  They seem to be good quality actually, even though they are real plain looking.  The problem is my stove has D-shaped knob shafts, and even the D-shape adapters on these knobs were too big for my stove.  I also see the problem with pulling and pushing the knobs, there'd be no way to pull these knobs unless you glue them on or something as another reviewer suggested.

I gave 3 stars because I think for the price, if you need knobs you might as well try these to see if they fit.  If they don't, just return them like I did.  If they had fit my stove I would've kept them and used them.",Defect
3,B00009V3UF,"They fit and the quality is okay.
The knobs are ivory, not white. The inlays are a shade of white, kind of grey. Neither the knob or the inlays are what is known as ""appliance white"", the norm for kitchen appliances and laundry machines. They do not come close to matching the color of the stove.
I bought these for a rental unit, so they are acceptable for the purpose. But I would choose black or chrome for my own home.",No defect
3,B00009V3UF,"Worked very fine, but doesn't look original. Would like to see more types of knobs available for the aftermarket consumer.",No defect
5,B00009V3UF,"Worked out great, had purchased a more expensive knob, and it just did not work out right. This one was a perfect fit due to the enclosed adapters.",No defect
1,B00009V3UF,"They don't even have ""on"", ""off"" or low, medium, high settings on them.  Very generic.  I ended up buying others. The connectors they provide to fit onto range didn't fit into their own knobs.",Defect
3,B00009V3UF,"These were bought to replace some very worn out  ones for a rental unit for a college student.  So they were OK.  Not very attractive or substantial. Did not have any temp gauge markings on the knobs. (Hi, Med., Low etc)  Fit is OK after some manipulations.",No defect
1,B00009V3UF,while the knob fits around peg on the stove the height is wrong.  I cannot turn on the stove with these knobs,Defect
2,B00009V3UF,I researched this product and it said it would fit my stove.  It did not and it cheaply made.  Thumbs down.,Defect
5,B00009V3UF,"I have a white Avanti gas range model # G2002CW. This item came with nice looking but flimsy knobs. Two of them had already easily broken. Those who own similar stoves know that you need to push the knobs in to get it to spark(clicking sound) for it to ignite the flame.

Anyway I looked everywhere for similar knobs but was unable to. Home Depot and Lowes only had standard universal ugly cheap looking black and silver knobs.

I went on the Avanti site and they had the same exact knobs which were expensive. I was weary of flimsy knobs so i was looking for the metal versions and they didn't exist.

Anyways I took a chance on this. The price was right and noticed that the universal adapters (btw they're small and large ""D"" shaped to fit where the knob connects the controls) fit perfectly. Also noticed that the plastic has a better and much stronger grip than the original knobs did and worked very well and were quite strong and more durable. It also come with metallic stick on labels so you can put the indicator whereever you want it.

Note for purchaser: Your best bet is to first push the universal adapters onto the metal ""D"" shaped control on your stove and THEN put the indicator sticker on the knob and then push it onto the adapter. They go in quite tight/snug and a bit difficult to take off(which is a good thing in this case as you will see).

It's been a few weeks now since I got this product and still going strong, looks great on my white stove and lovin it.

I highly recommend this product.",No defect
3,B00009V3UF,"considering the price to replace knobs from oem, this is a viable alternative if you don't mind an little ingenuity and tinkering, and ""not quite perfect"" feel afterwards.  They can be made functional.  I had to cut plastic pieces to insert in the bottom so the shaft would bottom out soon enough to engage the burner valve - i.e. 'push and turn'",Defect
3,B00009V3UF,"I wanted to replace a damaged knob that had a longer cylinder and none of ones that came with the kit were long enough and was not able to use this product.  I also considered replacing all of the knobs so they would match, but not enough of the cylinders were provided.",Defect
4,B00009V3UF,Knob covers do their job in keeping my grandsons little fingers from turning on the stove.  They are a little clumsy looking but worth it for keeping the twins safe.,No defect
3,B00009V3UF,"While this description says it will fit most gas ranges, it did not come close to fitting my GE profile cooktop knobs :(",Defect
1,B00009V3UF,"didn't fit at all,  for the price paid really expected a whole lot more.  money down the drain.  do not recommend.",Defect
4,B00009V3UF,"Bought these for my grandmothers stove. They fit decently, but when you pushed in the knob to turn on the gas they would just slide further in, rather than opening the valve. A little rubber cement fixed that though.",No defect
2,B00009V3UF,"I read the other reviews about the knobs not working because of issues with shaft length (please, stop giggling) but went ahead and ordered anyway because, hey, these are supposed to be universal, right? Wrong. They don't work on my gas cooktop either because, just as in those other reviews, they can't be pushed down to engage the igniter and turn properly. Oh, and they also look and feel really, really plasticky and cheap but, considering that the package of four costs less than the price of JUST ONE OEM knob for my stove, I wasn't expecting much and would have lived with them if they had worked properly.",Defect
1,B00009V3UF,"comes with 2 sets of adapters, but neither have a mechanism to stop the knob from sliding down too far, making it impossible to push down the knob to turn it as on most gas ranges.  also, the holes are not centered, so if you do manage to turn it, it follows a lopsided rotation.  smaller diameter than standard knob.  did not include extra overlays as advertised, only one set.  this product barely belongs in the dollar store!",Defect
3,B00009V3UF,"Fit the metal prod on my stove, but wouldn't push in the knob.  Tried filling it in with clay.  That worked well...until I used the oven.  Then the clay melted!  I might try plumber's putty if it's not flammable.",Defect
4,B00009V3UF,We needed this product for a stove of one of our rental properties that has gas stove. We received on time and it worked well since it has small adaptadors to fit different stoves.,No defect

5,B0000AYKNT,"I have had this machine for two years and I agree with other positive reviews. But I have another reason for wanting a small washer available--the spin cycle. When hand washing, I use only the spin cycle to remove excess water as my hands do not have the strength to squeeze enough and it takes two days for things to dry. The spinner solves this probem without harm and even sweaters dry quickly.",No defect
5,B0000AYKNT,"This machine has been a life saver..  I use it mostly for light clothing just a couple pieces at a time due to its small size...a week's supply of under shirts, skivvies and socks are no problem....one or two medium towels or maybe one or two sweat suits are fine....no problems within the year that I have it and the clothes come out as clean as our full size unit upstairs second floor, although I have to say the action on the larger loads doesnt seem like it would clean as well as it does.....would I buy the same again...absolutely.....wish they made a similar dryer though....I cant find one anywhere.............",No defect
5,B0000AYKNT,"I purchesd this washer last Summer and I must say that it washes clothes

very well. The only thing I found is that if the hose does not reach your sink, you would have to buy an extension type hose from Home Depot in order for it to reach your sink and also you cannot put too much detergent, just a right amount for washing. I really recommend this washer for those single

people out there who don't want to spend a lot of money in the Laundry.",No defect
5,B0000AYKNT,"I received my machine yesterday and I can't stop washing.  I just love it (so far).  It was easy to set up, except for the bottom panel, which I just put on with 4 screws(oh oh).  I couldn't line them all up.  I've done 4 loads without any problem.  They're clean and I am delighted.  I live in a small apartment and the noise isn't bad at all just like a dishwasher.  I'm especially impressed with the spin cycle, its great.  I have rebalanced the clothes but no big deal.  Its set up in my kitchen and its just perfect.  I've ordered the caster kit from Lowes' can't wait to get that.  I love it even without wheels.",No defect
5,B0000AYKNT,"I bought this a few weeks ago during a Friday Sale.  I would have never considered an item like this, but the reviews were all positive.  I was surprised that it worked so well.  Everything gets so CLEAN! It's super quiet.

I did have a problem with the first couple of loads, as water leaked into the floor.  I decided to try a low sudsing detergent, as suggested by several reviewers and that took care of it.  I bought Method HE (High Efficiency) detergent and it takes just a tiny bit to do a whole load.

My only complaint would be the Jingle Bells tune at the end of the wash. What were they thinking? LOL",No defect
2,B0000AYKNT,"Pro's:

- Lightweight machine is easy to move.

- Washes and spins-dry the clothes very well.

- Does not get unbalanced easily during spin.

Con's:

- I cannot get the machine to both fill and drain with the same exhaust hose setup.  The exhaust hose has to be UP to fill the machine, and DOWN to drain during the spin cycle.

- Machine thus needs to be monitored during the cycle such that I can move the exhaust hose up and down depending on whether it is washing or draining.",Defect
5,B0000AYKNT,This little gem has by far exceeded my expectations. I have experienced NONE of the complaints voiced by some of the other reviews. It gives me clothes that are washed and spun dried the same as my full sized washer used to do. I can highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to do small loads of normal wash.,No defect
5,B0000AYKNT,"I live in an apartment with no washer/dryer hookup, so I have been lugging my laundry over to the laundry facility in the building across to mine for over a year now!

I bought this machine and received it about 3 days later (4 days EARLIER than it was supposed to arrive...nice surprise!).  I have done about 5 loads of laundry in it so far.  Although it does look really small, it can fit a lot in it!  Another bonus is that it doesn't take a long time to do each load.  It's also fairly quiet, considering it's a portable machine!

It's not difficult to set it up, and after I received it, I was doing my first load of laundry about 30 minutes later.

I do have 2 complaints, however:

1) there are no wheels, so it is difficult to move around.  I solved this problem by purchasing those EZ Movers from Home Depot.  That way I am able to slide it around fairly easily.

2) the Jingle Bell buzzer....who's brilliant idea was that?  Although I must say that it is not as loud of a buzzer as I expected it to be.  I guess it will just take some getting used to!

Other than those 2 small issues, I absolutely love this washer and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is in my situation!

Ordering from Amazon was a breeze, and I couldn't believe how fast the free shipping was!  Thanks a lot!",No defect

4,B0000AYKNT,"Purchased this item for small loads during the week and was surprized at how well it worked. It worked well and most difficulties were in adjusting to a small machine such as amount of detergent and size of load. It fits nicely in the kitchen closet. Wish it had wheels, but isn't that heavy. The greatest feature is the tune Jingle bells. What teenager wants to have Christmas songs while their friends are visiting. Just a little threat to get the wash done or get embarassed. It gets that job done, the machine that is.

  Delivery was quick which in this area is great. Found it in my backyard by the kitchen door and used it that day.",No defect

4,B0000AYKNT,"I've only had two days with my new Haier washer, but I can tell you that it does what it says it does. We can fit two king-size sheets into it, which is our minimum requirement. We've cleaned about twenty loads with it now, and it works flawlessly. The only reason it is four stars instead of five is for the cheazy plastic hose that is included to hook up to your water system. It looks very possible for the cheap tube and plastic connectors to develop a leak. The manufacturer should have provided a hose that was the overall quality of the washer. So, you'll be very surprised at how tiny this guy is, but it sure does the job. Clothes come out fresh and clean, just like out of the big washers. And the spin takes most of the water out so the drying doesn't take all that long.",No defect
5,B0000AYKNT,"I got my Haier XQBM22-C Portable 4.9-Pound-Capacity Pulsator Washing System with Stainless-Steel Tub yesterday - Tuesday, December 20 (from Amazon - with free shipping and a $25.00 ""HoHoHoHo"" discount! - total price: $144.99) - after ordering it just last Friday. Four days from order until arrival is fantastic, especially this time of year. Amazon is truly amazing!

It took but a few minutes to unpack and set up the washer. The process is very easy. I did my first load (""medium"" size) and everything worked to perfection.

Today, however, I tried a ""large"" load and I put in too much Tide(R). Well, you guessed it - suds all over the floor (and you should have heard the comments made about me and my intelligence by my wife!). Haier recommends ""high efficiency"" laundry detergent and they aren't kidding. We'll be buying some tomorrow.

The washer, having no agitator, is very ""easy"" on clothing and its overall washing cycle is rather fast. It performs similarly to a front-loader (or one of the new agitator-less ""high efficiency"" top loaders). The stainless steel drum is a really nice touch - this is usually found only on the most expensive washing machines. It spins rapidly (it even re-balances the load itself in most cases) and extracts the water very well, thus minimizing drying time.

I notice that there are some differences between the operating manual which can be downloaded from Amazon's site and the printed one which is supplied by the manufacturer. The downloaded version is more helpful concerning operation (though the ""setup"" procedure in the printed manual is more accurate).

Though you must clean the lint filter every time, this is really no bother as it is extremely easy and convenient to do. The filter in the water inlet must also be cleaned monthly (depending on use), but this, too is reltively easy to do. (I can't get my fingers in to remove that filter; a pair of long-nose pliers made removing it easy.)

I do wish the unit had wheels - this would make moving it much more convenient, though its handles are well-placed and moving it is not really that big a deal. It is not too heavy and its weight is well-balanced; it is not awkward to carry.

I do have a question - WHO the h*** thought up ""Jingle Bells"" for an end-of-cycle alarm? Oh, brother!!

We bought this machine as an ""extra"" machine to use when we have only small or delicate loads or for use when our ""main"" washing machine breaks down. It is certainly an excellent purchase - the quality is high and the price is definitely right. I think we'll be using this little machine more often than we had initially anticipated.

I recommend it to anyone who has any need at all for a small automatic washer, either for use in an apartment or for an ""extra"" machine, as in our case.

And buy it from Amazon! They're terrific!

Update: December 14, 2006

I've had this machine for exactly a year now and I am as happy with it as when I first got it. The only issue I had was obtaining the caster kit which took many months to arrive (from PartStore<dot>com - an excellent company with which to deal). But it finally DID arrive and now it is much easier to move the machine next to the sink.

I have nothing but praise, so far, for the machine itself as well as Amazon's sales and service. I have some misgivings about Haier's responsiveness to customers as they would not answer either my questions or queries from PartStore as to when the caster kit would be available. They do make most parts available from PartStore, and other suppliers, so parts should be no problem, if ever needed. I ordered a few extra lint filters as that seems to be proprietary for this machine. Most other parts appear to be ""standard"" types.

==========================================================================

Update: December 17, 2007

It has been almost exactly two years now since we got this machine and I have to say that it remains excellent in all regards. I generally use it for washing underwear and often we use it at the same time we use our larger (regular) washing machine. Then we put both loads in the dryer. This saves us a lot of time.

I have purchased every replaceable item that I can from the above-mentioned PartStore. I was able to get the Caster Kit which makes moving the machine much easier. Unfortunately, that item is no longer being made by Haier - I'm glad I got it when I did. Other than a few proprietary items made for this machine, which I purchased, most of the machine appears to be made of common components which should be easy to obtain in the event of a breakdown.

My wife and I have been very satisfied with this machine, both in terms of its quality, and its price as sold by Amazon. Where else could you get a machine of this capacity and quality at a price of $144.99, which INCLUDES shipping?

As I said above, Amazon is truly amazing!

==========================================================================

Update: December 23, 2008

Well, another year has gone by and my Haier washing machine is still working perfectly.

I bought a number of ""spares"" from PartStore.com ""just in case"" but, so far, I have not had to use any of them.

I must say that the $144.99 I spent for this machine is just about the best $144.99 I have EVER spent!

If this machine is indicative of Haier appliances in general, then I can confidently predict a bright future for them.

The next time I am in the market for any appliance, Haier will definitely be on my ""short list.""

==========================================================================

Update: December 16, 2009

Here I am again. Still another year has gone by and this little washing machine continues to perform as it did when new. What more can I say other than the following: if this product is typical of Haier's quality, then the company is definitely a winner!

==========================================================================

Update: December 17, 2010

As this unit has long-since been discontinued, this will be my final comment on this machine.

It is now five years old and it still works as it did when it was new.

I can think of no better attribute nor can I think of any better compliment.

Haier makes newer models of portable washing machines (all at higher prices, unfortunately). If you are in the market for one, I STRONGLY recommend that you consider this brand. I had read of some peoples' problems with this particular model but I can say absolutely that I have had NOT EVEN ONE issue with it.

I bought a range of spare parts, the ones which are unique to this model - just in case; it seems that that was money wasted. I have never had to use any of them (other than to replace the lint filter once - I am quite careful with it). Most of the parts making up the machine are standard items which can be found in any local plumbing supply store.

Of all the items I have purchased from Amazon over the years, this product is by far the best value.

If and when it breaks down and cannot be repaired (and that eventuality does not appear to be happening any time soon!), I shall buy another Haier model.

I recommend Haier portable washing machines unreservedly.",No defect

5,B0000AYKNT,"i've had this machine for a week now and am absolutely delighted with it.  i've washed sheets, jeans and towels with no problems at all.  following other reviewer's suggestions, i used just a little bit of detergent (a bit over 1/8 cup) and not only did the clothes come out clean and fresh but there was no leaking at all.  i was a little worried about how long the clothes might take to dry but the machine did such a good job of spinning that they were dry in only a few hours.  assembly was a breeze but i did end up buying an extension for the water filling hose since the 4 foot hose included was not long enough.  jingle bells wasn't as annoying as i'd expected, although really, a beep would've been just fine...",No defect
4,B0000AYKNT,"I feel I made a good decision purchasing the product. I have two suggestions to some of the previous reviewers: 1. Read and FOLLOW the users' manual carefully. 2. Do not overload the machine. Some heavy clothes especially jeans are harder to balance when spinning. This is a problem of any SMALL washers not only for this particular product. My experience is, jamming the machine with more than three jeans is not a good idea, but pants made with softer material are ok. The washer can easily handle a Queen size spread sheet plus some little items.",No defect
3,B0000AYKNT,"Totally agree to those reviews claiming the pro and cons. Such as earthquake-then-stopped ""feature"". Bought this from Amazon for such a low price. I have learned to use it ever since. There are some tips on how to operate this machine more smoothly:

1. never load too much: that's the main cause to a stop. Too much load will lead to unbalanced load especially after the first couple of cycle, and when it spins to let go the remains of last wash, it shakes wildly and the built-in protection mechanism detects this as abnormalty and immediately shut the whole machine out. It's also necessary to have it tended ohterwise when it's left to run by itself while hitting a stop it will be stuck in the middle of washing cycle forever. maximum 70%  load in dry is good.

2. use mesh-bag for delicates protection: the tub really wears off your clothes, not to say tangling of clothes all the time.

3. secure the drain hose as tight as you can. The hose is really hard to attach anywhere, and if it's gone loose, it could spill all water on the floor.

4. manual isn't enough for you to have a good knowledge of operation - you might draw your curve of learning each time you use it.

5. the ending tune - yes, it's jingle bells all the time. I doubt Haier will allow choice of more tunes on this bery basic machine. You've got to appreciate their effort to make attractive to American folks:)

Haier, though not so well known here, is a top Chinese household brand in home appliances. From this washer, it looks it still leaves a lot to be desired to catch up with international giants. Low price isn't all.",Defect
5,B0000AYKNT,"It fits really well in my small apartment. The hose is a little short but you can buy one in Lowes to make it longer. It is true that if you put too many detergent/water in, it will flood a little. It will make some big noise and stop spinning some time as mentioned by someone earlier, but I think it is mainly because you put too many stuff or some heavy clothes in it. After all, it is only a small washer! But it does the job very well. I am very pleased with it and we never went to laudry again after having it! It well worths the money!",No defect
1,B0000AYKNR,"As the other reviewers have stated, the dispenser freezes in the back and does not thaw, nor does the temperature of the dispenser work correctly, mine runs warm even at the highest setting.  Although customer service will document your call in Ottawa, their corporate office in New York will not return my call.  The three repair numbers customer service gave me did no good as I was also told by one repair person that Haier does not reimburse the repairs and as a result they will not come out to my home.  Customer service told me twice that they have recommended to the corporate office to replace my unit, but of the five to six calls I have placed over the past two months, I have not received any calls that any progress or action will be taken.  I have been trying to get my dispenser serviced since September.",Defect

1,B0000AYKNR,I bought this as a gift for someone.  It was ordered and delivered promptly but the dispensing parts were missing.  Since it was ordered from [...] I contacted them to send the remaining parts.  They were mostly uncooperative and 16 days later the missing parts finally arrived from Haier as a warranty claim that was filed.  I have no idea how Haier received a warranty claim because when I contacted Haier they told me I bought a refrigerator not a beer dispenser!  Once the dispensing parts were installed I found out the compressor had a leak in it and needed to be replaced and now I'm waiting for those parts.  So far it's been one month and I've paid for a gift that can not be used.,Defect
4,B0000AYKNR,"I've had this unit for about six months and I'm quite happy with. You have to play around a bit to get the temperature and pressure right. Once they are set right though, you can switch out a keg without having to go through the whole routine every time. Flushing the lines is no better or worse that with other kegerators. I like the unit because I can serve great draft beer at a slightly lower cost per glass than cans and bottles. I LOVE not having to deal with returnables any more! There are two downsides to the kegerator. First, I had visions of rolling the kegerator around in my house or on my patio. The first time I tried, however, the frame members holding the rollers bent and nearly snapped off. Better to put this unit in one spot and leave it there. Second (and this is common to all kegerators), you'd better have a VERY stong back or a keg dolly because even a 1/4 keg is extremely heavy.",No defect
4,B0000AYKNR,"After some research and a number of conversations with a friend, I opted to purchase this product.  I have to say, it's awesome! The beer stays cold and is readily available; probably too available. :)  My ONLY complaint is that the fridge has a few scuff marks on it that appear to be the result of the packaging process (not the shipping).  But after a little assembly and a couple of beers, those scuff marks weren't much of an issue. Also I'm quite impress at how quickly I received the product; within 4 days!",No defect

4,B0002KXMT4,"We really love our apartment-sized Haier washer.  This little washer has all the features of a normal sized machine, but uses much less space and is on rollers so we can hide it away when not in use.

Our normal load might consist of two pairs of jeans and three shirts.  The washer handles this without a problem.  The spin cycle, although prone to being imbalanced and needing to have the clothes rearranged, spins the clothes to where they are only damp, and will dry within a few hours - less if you have a fan blowing on them.

Why only four stars?  When we first received the washer, water would leak from under the top where the water hose was screwed in.  Not where the hose met the inlet, but underneath.  That stopped on the second use.  Perhaps there was a valve that was not seated.  The second thing is ongoing, but is not a deal breaker.  The computer that controls the cycles will sometimes become confused, and you have to turn it off and restart whatever cycle your clothes were on.  Not a big deal, and perhaps only happens twice a month.  We do use the washer often - probably twice a week to keep up with things.

I would without a doubt recommend this washer.",No defect

4,B0002KXMT4,"I received this washer a little over 3 months ago and I am very VERY happy with my purchase! This little guy is so convenient, especially since I work at a hospital, where I need my scrubs washed constantly. I would advise to be careful when hooking up the water host from the sink to the washer. I have to make sure there aren't any leaks before I start washing otherwise there will be a large puddle to clean up! I always hook up the hose, and then just turn on the water at the sink. The hose should stop the water from going into the drum, and if there are any leaks you will see them right away. If there are any, I just re-adjust the connection and repeat the process until there are no leaks at all. Most of the time it only takes one try and I am ready to go, but sometimes I have to re-adjust a couple or even three more times. But this machine is very reliable and it fits perfectly in my room!",Defect

I have a samsumg it a large washing machine, washes 3 cubit foot of laundry at the time, not 5cf as advertised, uses only liquid detergent the cycle is at least an hour, uses extremes amounts of water, the washing cycle alone is only 9 minutes, it does not spin properly, it is very expensive!.",No defect

5,B0002KXMT4,"I first bought a different washing device (don't know what I was thinking) from Amazon, and while that washer DID work, everything was done by HAND. If you've ever used a hand powered washer or washed dedicates by hand, you know what I'm talking about. Since I'm a retired vet, on my pension, who doesn't drive and can't walk the 4 blocks down to the neighborhood laundromat the Haier is a godsend.

I can easily wash two days worth of clothes in a single mixed load, 3 pairs of jeans, on the ""Heavy"" load setting, come out beautifully, and the spin cycle means even I can lift them out of the washer drum and hang them outside or in my shower to dry (something I couldn't do with hand washing and wringing them out before hang drying), WITHOUT getting drip water all over the bathroom or getting the clothes I was wearing, soaked.

1)  Setup took about 20 minutes total. I actually went back through again because I couldn't believe it was that simple. It fit my kitchen faucet just fine.

Assembly was easy. It arrived in good shape.
Once you get to know how many garments to wash at a time it washes fine. Polar fleece seems to be the heaviest weight when wet, (heavier than towels). Could be me but, I had to adjust the wheels so the unit was not plumb to get the washer tub centered in the machine (my floor is not level though). This helped to keep the load and washer tub balanced.

I did have a little trouble putting it together simply because I am a small woman and not very strong. It was a matter of not fitting the hoses together tight enough. So at first there was a small leak. But after my husband tightened up the nozzles and junk I have had no problems whatsoever.

5,B0002KXMT4,"I owned this very machine years ago when I was divorced and it worked excellent for a single man doing a load each night. This allowed me keep the hamper empty and not waste water. I found that it spun the clothes until lightly damp and that only required me to hang the clothes on a dry rack overnight. This meant I could get a small dry rack and if I needed a work shirt the next morning it would be ready.
I just bought this machine for my daughter and boyfriend and they are raving about it because it is doing the same as it did for me. I unpacked it and it was sturdy and unharmed as it was layered in a box within a box and bubble wrap in between. The motor assembly and tub are held in place sturdily with Styrofoam to keep the moving parts safe. Assembly is easy, I should have let my 22 year old daughter do it and she has no special assembly skills.
Buy this machine for up to two adults and a child and you will be happy. This machine has more settings such as just putting it on an extra rinse or spin and it does a better job of spinning out the water than the $1200 whirlpool apartment setup they rented from the local rental store. Boy are they glad the rented that first to find out it was junk and Dad had tried this before and knew what to buy as they love it just as I did.

Anyway, I got it all set up and was looking forward to attaching the hose to the faucet and doing my first load then writing a great review. Then I spent over an hour trying to figure out why the adapter would not attach to my faucet and trying to decipher the very sparse instructions and weirdly uninformative diagrams. I don't have a particularly fancy nor rare faucet style but the adapter that comes w/ the washer doesn't even come close to fitting. They're almost exactly the same diameter. One will not fit inside the other. I'm clearly doing something wrong and will have to buy a wrench to see if I can ""remove the aerator"" like the instructions say, but it's annoying that a ""quick start easy connect"" adapter can be such a pain in the butt on a run of the mill faucet. I could see if I had some strange faucet, but it's just basic and run of the mill. Nothing outstanding about it, so you'd think an ""easy fit"" universal adapter would have no problem. I'm writing a review simply to say that while it's probably ""easy"" for 95% of people, it could also not be ""easy"" and if that happens, you're basically out of luck in terms of getting help, b/c the diagrams and troubleshooting tips are completely useless...",Defect

2,B0002KXMT4,"This ""portable"" washer has no handles, is not available with wheels, is too heavy to lift easily, and the instructions make it clear Haier's lawyer's want it permanently installed.  I bought it specifically for portability, so I put it on a dolly.

It is three months old.  It has developed an annoying habit of shutting off in the middle of the normal wash cycle.  So far, it has been possible to turn the power back on and restart it, but this does not bode well for the future.

The faucet adaptor is easy to apply and remove, but the two pieces slip apart easily.  They do not slip back together easily.  Trying to do so by hand will  create a spectacular water fountain, which you will discover when it sprays halfway across the room.  By the time you finish cleaning up the mess, you will enjoy beating the adaptor back into order with a hammer, which is the only way to do it.

You are supposed to level the machine.  I did not bother since it gets moved. Therefore I do not blame it for leaking a bit - np - kitchen floors need  mopping.

For approximately $200 US, the cycle switch should have worked longer than three months.  The adaptor is a pain.  And it is annoying that Haier advertises it as portable but means it to be stationary.

If you're in the market for a portable washer, try something cheaper first.",Defect

I bought it because I have a newborn & she goes through a lot of clothes, bibs, burp cloths & stuff. I basically have only used it for baby things (I have washed a few items of mine tho). The wash cycle is very weak in the way it moves but it must be cleaning because (white) clothes will go in with formula stains & comes out clean (and that's without bleach).

5,B0002KXMT4,"This washer does a basic job of getting clothes clean.  The key is to not overload this washer.  One load will hold a maximum of 2 pairs of pants, or 3 shirts.  Attempting to put more in, will result in clothes remaining over the water level, and not getting clean.  Other reviewers have had problems with loads becoming off-balance.  I've never had a load go off balance, in the few months I've owned it.

The portability is great.  I keep the washer in my bedroom when not in use, then roll it into the bathroom when it's time to do laundry.  It quickly connects to the bathroom sink.  My sink did not require an adapter, however some sinks will.  I haven't experienced any leaks or overflows.  Water stays where it's suppose to.",No defect

1,B0002KXMT4,"In two sentences: I LOVED this washing machine until it broke down after only three months; the customer service is so terrible that I would never again buy anything from Haier.

I live in a tiny apartment and normally had my laundry done by a pickup&delivery service. I bought this washing machine to do the laundry for my baby, and quickly began to do some of my own laundry in it as well.
I was very happy with this product in the first three months. It was easy to install and to operate. Spinning was so good that the clothes were almost dry when I took them out of the machine.

Then, after three months, the machine started making loud sounds during the cycle, and wouldn't spin anymore.

I called customer service on June 8. They said that there is no service for this machine, and that they would send me a replacement unit. The customer service representative even asked me to call two days later, to get a tracking number.
It is now July 14, and in the past 6 weeks I have called Haier every two days or so. Every time I was told that they were awaiting a response from the ""corporate office"" (which is apparently in New Jersey, whereas the customer service is in Ohio). Over and over again they promised to call me back in ""3 to 4 business days"". Of course they never did.

Finally today - 6 weeks after I was told a replacement unit was on the way - they tell me that there are no replacement units in stock (or equivalent units), and that I would be refunded instead.

They refuse to refund me for the $80 taxes, shipping, and handling I paid originally, or to send a technician to look at it.
Not to mention the cost of laundry in the 6 weeks since I called.

And who knows when - or if - will I get the promised refund.",Defect
3,B0002KXMT4,"I have had this machine for about 1 year now.
Pros:
1. It is nice to have a washing machine when there is no hookup. Our apartment doesn't have hookups for both a dishwasher AND a washing machine, so this washing machine goes in our bathroom and works well there.
2. You don't have to use the laundrymat.
3. It wrings out clothes very well. They are almost dry when they come out!
4. It finishes a cycle fairly quickly.
5. It is fairly quiet.

Cons:
1. This machine has to be babysat. It tends to over balance VERY easily even with 1 or 2 items. It will fill up and spin continously over and over to help dislodge the clothes until either you manually fix the clothes or it shuts off and beeps. A waste of water and fabric softener.
2. Clothes get stretched out. If you don't have a dryer, your clothes will eventually be too big for you!!!
3. The normal cycle has a short cycle for washing clothes but will rinse them out too many times. I use the heavy cycle and that seems to clean clothes better.
4. You need HE detergent or use a fabric softener to control the amount of suds generated.
5. Sometimes the machine will continously drain and not fill up. You have to make sure the drain pipe is not below the fill line.",No defect
5,B0002KXMT4,"Based on all the reviews listed here - and the price - I chose the Haier HLP21E.  Thanks for all the info on the bottom plate and the screws.  I only had to purchase a stronger screwdriver to force the screws through the metal.  The machine is so quiet I had to keep checking to be sure it was running.  The faucet adapter works with the bathroom sink and the hose runs into the bathtub, draped over the drying rack.  A great purchase.

UPDATE 06/04/2009 - Water started gushing out of the faucet adapter into the sink, but I just had to wiggle the hose to be sure that the first 3-4"" below the faucet were absolutely perpendicular.

Today I actually washed a queen-size comforter and all is well.  Certainly do not recommend anything that large but I was desperate.  (I'm on crutches and can't carry anything down to the laundry room.)

5,B0002KXMT4,"Just got my portable washer yesterday. It came from Target, was double-boxed and arrived in perfect condition. I had no trouble following the set-up instructions, and had the machine up and running within an hour. I live in a small cottage, with a connected livingroom and kitchen (where I run the machine). The first load was a week's worth of socks, underwear and a set of scrubs (for one person), and I selected the medium water level, which was plenty for this load. The machine ran through the wash cycle without a problem, and was surprisingly quiet. The spin cycle did a great job of removing water from the clothes. This washer is perfect for me, a single person in a small living space, and so far has exceeded my expectations.

July 2009 Update: Well, my little Haier washer is still going strong! I generally do one or two loads per week, and I've had no problems at all with the washer. I also wash my bedding (full size sheets) and towels and the machine handles them well. The secret is not overloading, and setting the water level high enough to ensure that the items can move freely around inside the tub. The only down side to this model is the lack of casters (I believe there's another of this size that came with casters, but may no longer be available). Others have resolved this problem by putting the machine on a platform with casters.",No defect

On the other hand I can't say much for the place that I ordered it from it was suppose to arrive in a few days I even paid extra instead it didn't arrive for 3 weeks I guess I should have ordered it from a target store website.

5,B0002KXMT4,"A great washing machine. I've owned this sweet machine for almost 3 months. You can put more clothes in it then it says. BUT! Don't over load it or the clothes will not wash correctly. Has several cycles. Easy to hook up to the bathroom sink. I just put the drain hose over the side of the tub. Now I never have to go out to wash my clothes or use a machine that had someone elses dirty clothes in it. And, all the money I save. It's so quiet no one will ever know you have a washing machine. It takes up very little space. It's worth every penny it cost. I love it. I love it. The delivery was sooooo fast. It is sent by freight. Amazon.com is and always has been a great service and product provider.
  FOLLOW UP: It's two years now and I still love this machine. The only problem I've had is this March 2013 the Spin belt went. After checking with some appliance repair companies  as to the charge I decided to fix it myself. Nowhere could I find info on how or even find a ""REPAIR"" manual. I was having a problem with getting the Belt ON. To make a long story short, I just got mad enough (Kids) that I put gloves on and with all my strength got it on. (I was afraid of ruining the new belt. In the past I wouldn't have had a ""Strength"" problem, but at 77 years I've lost a lot of strength. Doing it myself saved me $75/80 in labor and $25/30 in parts. I bought my part from Repair Clinic on line. It was the cheapest price even with shipping.
UPDATE:  June 2014. Machine still running great. A great washing machine. The only repair I've had to make so far, is a spin belt replacement which I did myself.  As a side note: because I am unable to keep the machine in the bathroom, I have to bring it into the bathroom/kitchen (or where ever your water hook up is) when I use it.  Which shows it's light enough for one to pick up.",No defect

5,B0002KXMT4,"I've had the Haier HLP21E now for about five months, washing six to eight loads a week.  So far, so good.  I also bought the caster set that Haier sells, so I don't have to break my back lugging it back and forth to the sink every day.  The caster set is worth the money, but keep in mind that some of the stores are charging double what Haier charges.  The cost should be about $25.

It's not a quiet machine.  It's not horribly loud, but it's certainly not quiet. I think most people who claim it is are simply going into another room and turning up the TV.  If you have an apartment with tissue paper walls and fear the landlord might hear the noise, get a solid lie ready. This is actually quite fun. I find it very easy to hide this washer under a table cloth or even in my closet!

The inner wash tub is only about one cubic foot, so you will have to do about three loads for every single load you would for a standard size washer.

This brings me to an issue that is important for potential buyers.  Over the months, I've seen people making wild claims about the amount of clothes they can put in this washer.  Please be aware that some are full of beans.  You are NOT going to be able to stuff five pairs of adult denim jeans in this, or king-size sheets and pillow cases, or eight bath towels.  Either people are confusing this model with another larger Haier, or they are people who like to wear their own body soil repeatedly, or they are lying.  Use some common sense.  Firstly, there is not the physical room for the enormous amounts of clothes that are often being claimed.  Secondly, if you stuff the machine full to the top, the soil will not completely rinse out, but will merely redeposit over larger areas. This is disgusting. Out-of-sight should not be out-of-mind when doing laundry.

You should never fill any washer more than half to two-thirds full of dry clothes, so don't do it with this washer.

Because there is no agitating spindle in this washer, heavy pieces of clothes might move to one side of the tub as it empties of water, in preparation for a spin.  If it goes off-balance, a fuzzy-logic will kick in and the tub will stop and refill with water in an attempt to rebalance the clothes.  This can happen easily with bath towels.  I just pause the machine before it goes into a spin, and redistribute them.

Use a good, HE detergent.  You only need about a teaspoon or two, depending on what you are washing.

Remember that the bottom plate goes on the machine with the curvy side ""out"", facing the floor.

Customer Service at Haier USA is a joke.  They don't know what they are talking about, if pressed will admit to never having seen a Haier washer, and they are just plain stupid.  If you really have an issue with your machine, harrass the Customer Service morons until they forward you to Technical.  They will do this if you scream enough and make them cry.",No defect

I got this machine from Amazon a few days ago. I read the instruction carefully before installed. The instruction and the product indicated how to place the plate correctly onto the bottom. This machine is perfect for 2 persons. The clothes dry easily because the spin is strong enough.  The machine is not very noisy, and understand it should have some kind of sound when it washes or spin.  I used the box which came with this machine to cover it because I don't want my apartment manager knows, and it help a little bit on the sound.
I lived at the 3rd floor and my apartment doesn't have laundry. It saved my life a lot.
At the beginning, I thought that it would deliver by UPS but it was not. I tracked the package everyday to make sure I have someone standby to receive the package because it is a heavy case, over 60 lbs., I didn't want it returned. When I tracked the package was arrived the city, the shipping company will call or email you to contact them to arrange the delivery, I was so happy with it.

(Sept. 12, 2010)  After 2 years, everything works fine.  Very important, don't put too much clothes in one load, after a few try, I know how to balance for every load.

Ok from some of the reviews I see people can't read an owners manual, or are talking about an older modle. Read the Owners Manual then assemble the bottom plate, put in the almost idiot proof lint filter (it says Top,on the top and bottom on the bottom which is soooo easy to clean,and you must clean it every time.) level the machine adjusting the feet (you will need a level, I got a magnetic plastic one for 99 cents from the hardward store), and your ready to wash clothes.  It's QUIET!!! very Quiet. You should use the HE laundry soap. It will nicely and quietly wash a set of full sized cotton sheets, including the two pillow cases, I have washed two pairs of heavy Jeans in it. I do a wash every other day. The controlls are so easy, and check this out you loose power and machine remember were it was in the cycle you just press the start button it takes off where it left off. It dings when it's done but does so quietly,if you leave the top up after putting in the clothes and soap it dings at the start of the wash cycle, to remind you to put the cover down. I can't even think of any thing negative to comment on. OH and the stainless steel basket is a HUGE plus if you live with hard water. One of the BEST features is whe the clothes come out of the machine they are dryer then any full sized I have used! This is a wonderful product, some of the negative responces are from people that either try to overload it or put in too much soap. I have used regular soap, but using less than a 1/4 cap full.

5,B0002KXMT4,"this little washer is excellent!
i checked reviews on several machines before buying this one.  wanted the washer/dryer combo from thor, but there seem to be numerous mechanical problems.  especially surprising considering the price.  also looked at the little ""wonder washer"" mini portable washer and rejected it for the same reason.  it's apparently cheaply made, doesn't work well and got more bad reviews than good.
the haier reviews made me a little nervous, too, until i noticed that all the bad ones said the same thing.  it leaks if connections are not tight enough, it makes a horrible sound if the plate is put on upside down, and it mustn't be over-loaded or have too much detergent put in.  all of this amounted to consumer error.  i really needed the washer and decided to take a chance.  it's one of the best decisions i ever made.  the only problem i had was with installing the plate.  as everyone has mentioned, the holes don't match and the screws are too large.  i remedied this by very gently enlarging the holes on the bottom of the machine with an ice pick, being careful not to damage any working parts.  got the machine running soon and i've been using it several times a week since it arrived two months ago.
one other thing.  in reference to the metal plate being improperly installed, there were comments about instructions not being clear.  something may have changed since those reviews were written because the instruction book i have is quite explicit, and the plate is clearly marked.  the directions are actually pressed into the metal.  there is no way i would have put it on wrong.  either people were ignoring this or (more likely, i think)haier took note of the problem and did something about it.
anyway, if you're in need of a washer and short on space, do get one of these.  it's well worth the money.

5,B0002KXMT4,"I live in a New York City apartment.  Although there is a laundry room in our building there is nothing like having your own washer to do laundry at your own convenience.  No waiting for the machine, no correct change/dollars, no wondering what was washed in the machine before your wash...in otherwords a real must have item.
This adapts to the kitchen sink faucet so easily.  The drain hose never overflows the sink's capacity.
You can't wash many heavy items all at once.  You do have to plan how you'll do laundry.  I manage to get all my underwear, socks, t-shirts, night shirts (light items) all in one load.  My bed sheets and pillow cases in another.  Jeans, well, you have to be careful.  I would recommend no more than four pairs at once, of course, I'm petite so a larger/taller person I would recommend no more than 2 pairs at once.  Then the bath towels and I'm done!
I couldn't live without this machine now that I have it.  It is a huge value for the money.  Also, Haier is so easy to deal with regarding any  service problems or questions.

It's convenient in terms of size and connections, but if you're like me and used to IKEA-like exactness of everything matching up perfectly and fitting snugly, you will be disappointed.  The hose leaks at each end, and the bottom plate barely fits the bottom.

I was only able to fully complete the wash cycle on the first load.  I'm not sure what it is, but the washer keeps re-rinsing without ever finishing.  I'm gonna try again with a lighter load.

On the other hand, I lived with a friend who has the same one (which is why I bought it) and it works fine.  Before purchasing, make sure that you have an even, hard (concrete) surface on which to position it while washing.  This  is not a good unit for older houses with less than ideal plumbing or small sinks.

It also depends on where you live.  In NYC it's great if you're in a small space and don't feel like carrying a bag of laundry around the streets.  However, in a place you can move around by car that has laundromats nearby, this washer isn't worth the trouble.  Plus, laundromats have driers, and you'll be done with your clothes a lot quicker.

1,B0002KXMT4,"With the unit I received, when I set the water level to high, it would make a terrible grinding noise without starting the wash cycle. It did, indeed, sound like a jack hammer, but was probably its insides disintegrating. Fortunately, the spin cycle worked fine, so I was able to drain the tub.

With the water level set to medium, the wash cycle did commence, but consisted of a feeble swishing back and forth (it operates by shooting jets of water through the sides of the tub while doing a half-spin) that did little to clean clothes. I washed one load twice and it still came out smelling slightly off - possibly though I didn't use enough detergent, based on advice from earlier reviews. Following that, I packed it up to return.

It's unreasonable to expect high quality with this product line, but every part of this machine is as cheap as could be used in its manufacture. The drain hose is of stiff, inflexible plastic that would undoubtedly break one day. There were slight leaks that caused puddles underneath, and also from the water hose connection. The metal plate you have to attach to the bottom has to be bent to make it fit - fortunately, it's not much thicker than a piece of aluminum foil. When I removed it to repackage the washer, there were bits of rubber and a film of oil on it, just from a couple uses. It's unlikely this machine would last very long.

There is a little entertainment to be had from the broken English instructions printed on top of the machine. The manual is a little better grammatically, but still not of much practical use. I can't say I would buy this brand again.",Defect
3,B0002KXMT4,"Getting one of these for our apartment was great. No more running out in the cold just to wash some work clothes. The setup was a breeze (although, there was a bit of a mishap on my part when I didn't tighten one of the connections tightly enough, thus spraying water on myself, my unsuspecting girlfriend, and a very shocked pair of cats.

Our kitchen floor is pretty unbalanced, so we're unable to do anything larger than a medium load without the machine making a horrendous churning sound.

If you live in an apartment and are tired of always having to set aside every quarter you come across, get this product.",No defect

4,B0002YTLZY,"i found what i needed for its purpose. the range hood blends in perfectly with the rest of my kitchen. the only negative thing i'd have to note is it is a bit noisy but for the price i paid that is to be expected otherwise, it really is perfect;)",No defect

5,B0002YTLZY,"I ordered this range hood despite my husband's misgivings about what we would end up with. He loves me just as much after it arrived as he did before I ordered it, maybe even a little more. I kept him from having to drive 60 miles to find a range hood for that price. We had looked here in the community where we live but the only range hoods they offered were 3 times the price and looked a whole lot cheaper. When the Broan 30"" 2 speed hood with light arrived the package was in mint condition, the color was right, it fit, our contractor installed it and I love it. This is a lot of hood for the money. It's better constructed than many I had looked at. I feel confident the controls will hold up better if used by children or grandchildren as may be the case with this range hood.",No defect

4,B0002YTLZY,"Range hoods are so expensive. I was in sticker shock looking for a replacement to the one I had at the time. That is, until I found this one on Amazon. I couldn't believe its price. I ordered and got it. Mind you, it is an economy model. The fan is a bit loud. The edges are not exactly square, i.e., I can see a little gap between the hood and the cabinet to its left with the gap bigger at the bottom than the top. But, it works as advertised. The light works. The fan is strong. And, it looks good. People really don't notice the gap that I mentioned.",No defect

5,B0002YTLZY,"Yes, it's very plain, very basic. And it doesn't cost a lot. And it works... perfectly. What more could you ask? Installation was a breeze: one wire nut to connect the white wires, and another to connect the black. Wrap the ground wire around the terminal screw and tighten it, and you're ready to mount the unit to the underside of the cabinet above your range. Screw in a light bulb and turn on the power-- you're done. Cheap, easy to install, and it runs like a pickleseeder... I like it.",No defect

Good price too.",No defect
5,B0002YTLZY,"Nice basic replacement for the broken range hood that came with our house. The old NuTone was completely dead, so, we purchased this as a replacement. The product came packaged relatively okay. There was a small dent in the upper fold on the back of the unit, but since it would be barely noticeable, we didn't bother replacing it. The NuTone I took out was recessed in the top, and the electrical supply from the wall was near the top of the unit about 3 inches over from the corner. This unit is completely flush topped and has two knockouts, one on the top, and one in the rear about 7 inches in from the corner. I had to cut a swath of the drywall behind the hood to get the power supply to line with the knockout. Not a huge issue, but slightly annoying.

There are instructions for a recessed cabinet install as well. The unit out of the box is fine for a flush bottom cabinet. Figures I have recessed bottoms. Instead of installing filler wood to make flush for the mounting holes, I opted to use longer wood screws with washers and tie right into the bottom shelf in the rear, and use smaller holes on the front lip of the range hood to bite into the front fascia of the cabinet. Make sure you drill pilots for the screws. 1/8"" drill bit works beautifully. Once hung, make your electrical connections. There are no wire nuts supplied, so, make sure you have some handy. Everything else went beautifully, the unit is solidly in place, and everything works perfectly. Switches are substantial and we put a 75 watt equivalent LED bulb in there, so we can actually see what we are cooking now!

I would have rated 4.5 due to the dent in the unit. The box was not damaged, so, it came from the factory with that issue. Since unit works as desired and it wasn't a huge problem with the dent, it retained a 5 star review.",No defect

1,B0002YTLZY,"I bought this unit to replace an older Broan ducted range hood. I've had this for about six months and this thing is absolutely worthless. The fan is positioned in the worst possible place - in the middle at the very back of the unit - the only steam, smoke, etc. it could catch would have to come from the control panel of the stove - where there are no burners. As it is now, steam from boiling pots just go over the front edge of the hood and up to the cabinet doors, where it condenses and runs down them, over the hood and back onto the stove; or it gathers under the hood, condenses and runs down the wall behind the stove. Now I regret replacing the other unit. Don't bother with this model unless you have some bizarre stove that has one burner, right in the middle of the very back of the cooktop.",Defect

However; it was dented. But the the dent was small & in the back where it wouldn't be seen, so
I kept it, to avoid the return hassle. The fan was a bit noisy at first, but after running it a few times
it quieted down and its fine now.",No defect

4,B0002YTLZY,I am in the middle of remodeling my kitchen and I wanted a hood range to replace the oversized one I had.  I started doing price checks at all of the local stores and they were just way to expensive. I didn't want anything fancy just one that worked pretty good. So I checked on Amazon and found this one so I bought it hoping it wouldn't be to big and it wasn't. The price was good but the quality not so great. It's one of those you get what you pay for. Obviously it is very basic on/off light and high/low fan. The only issue I have is you have to turn the fan on before or right when you start cooking or your whole house will get smokey. It is very easy to clean and to change the lightbulb.,No defect

5,B0002YTLZY,"We finally had to replace our range. And I do mean finally the range was at the house before we were! No joke it was original to the house which was built in 1976! Back in the 70's gold must have been a popular color for appliances in a kitchen. I personally only like white for kitchen appliances, but when we moved in all the appliances were still working so I couldn't justify replacing them due to the fact I didn't like the color. One by one they finally started to fail and each time they were replaced with white.

When it came time to replace the range we had serious trouble trying to find one to fit in the space we had. We finally found one and only one to fit the space. But the range hoods that went with the brand of the range were expensive yet looked awful! We were very happy to find this range hood. It looks great with the new range.",No defect
